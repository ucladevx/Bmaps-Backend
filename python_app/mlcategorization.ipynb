By means of these inexpensive, light and automated small-format cameras, cinema began a new stage, distanced from the specific and exclusionary technical knowledge of historical filmmaking, Super 8 proposed an inclusive and informal amateurism.  Throughout Latin America, and in particular in Argentina (where Super 8 production remains active to this day), Super 8 was adopted early by occasional filmmakers, but, above all, by a handful of artists who saw in the new format an opportunity to capture personal explorations that would redefine the very limits of the technology.

If there exists any Latin American specificity of meta-cinema, The Vampires of Poverty (Agarrando pueblo, 1977), by Luis Ospina and Carlos Mayolo, is one of the starting points of that tradition.  It reflects on the representation of poverty in Latin America, produced by privileged local filmmakers and financed by European funders in search of the elusive \"real\" in Third World cinema.  Ospina and Mayolo accompanied the 1978 Parisian premiere of The Vampires of Poverty with a manifesto entitled \"What is Poverty Porn?\\u201d, which represents a new level of self-awareness and critique surrounding the foreign perception of Latin American film.  Ximena Cuevas\\u2019 Cinepolis, la capital del cine (Cinepolis, the Film Capital, 2003) presents an insider\\u2018s unsettling perspective on the everyday world of image-making and image consumption.  The cinematic apparatus is foregrounded in the Cuban critique of flawed and careless production in Enrique Colina Barnet\\u2019s Chapucerias (1987), while the Brazilian conceptual short Duelo (Duel, 1973), by Daniel Santiago, is a conceptual game that represents the tensions between Super 8 and 16mm filmmakers. \\n\\nDigital, color & b/w.

A major figure in the Brazilian avant-garde, Humberto Mauro believed that spoken dialogues and intertitles detracted from the moving image.  Instead, he integrated text in the form of speech bubbles in his experimental cinematic melodrama, Ganga Bruta (1932). The use of text on the screen finds a master of ambiguity and irony in Cuba, with Nicol\\xe1s Guill\\xe9n Landri\\xe1n.  Following Santiago Alvarez's tradition, Guill\\xe9n Landri\\xe1n, nephew of the poet laureate Nicol\\xe1s Guill\\xe9n, playfully uses text in interaction with images on many different levels, generating a corrosive sense of irony and confusion rather than clarification in allegedly \\u201cdidactic\\u201d educational documentaries.

Consolidated Companies coworkers Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton (in her big-screen debut!) band together after believing they\\u2019ve poisoned their backstabbing, handsy head honcho (Dabney Coleman).  Ms. Fonda\\u2019s new production company, IPC, was at the helm for this timely, candy-colored, yet darkly hilarious satire that envisions a dream workplace free from tyrannical leadership.  The heightened reality of this wildly successful and popular farce finds perfection in a femme-led office utopia, and a cathartic world where bigots are punished for their transgressions.  With interludes into dream-like fantasyscapes, multiple kidnappings, and an incredible scene of weed-enhanced female bonding, 9 to 5 proves that \\u201cyou can run an office without a boss, but you can't run an office without the secretaries.\\u201d\\n\\n35mm, color, 109 min. Director: Colin Higgins. Cast: Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, Dabney Coleman.\\n\\n---\\n\\nShe Married Her Boss  (1935)\\n\\nHighly competent executive secretary Julia Scott (Claudette Colbert) willingly plays \\u201coffice wife\\u201d for department store owner Richard Barclay (Melvyn Douglas).  But when she marries her boss for what she hopes is love, Julia quickly learns that Richard can only think of a \\u201cpartnership\\u201d in terms of how it might help his business.  This cheery romp from the comedic mind of the sorely underrated Gregory La Cava (My Man Godfrey) features Ms. Colbert at peak charm, flirt and wit, with a bouncy script that keeps pace with her comedic wiles. Featuring a bold-faced assessment of gender politics that advances well beyond the overriding sentiment of its Depression-era backdrop, She Married Her Boss maintains that sometimes, work can mix with play.\\n\\n35mm, b/w, 85 min.

Whiting is also a partner of WW Architecture, a practice that she co-founded with her partner, Ron Witte, in 1999. WW recently completed the EL House in Houston, which received a Texas Society of Architects design award. Their competition entry for the Oujda soccer stadium also received a TSA award. They are currently completing design development of the Kaihui Exchange, an environmental, agricultural and business tourism center outside Changsha, China, which is expected to break ground in early 2017.\\n\\nWhiting\\u2019s interests are interdisciplinary, with the built environment at their core. She possesses an indefatigable curiosity about how individuals constitute a public and through what forms that public manifests itself in both architecture and urbanism and is then, in turn, formed. In her teaching, writing and practice, Whiting focuses on architecture\\u2019s public audience and how architecture can engage that collective subject. \\n\\nWhiting received her undergraduate degree from Yale University, organizing her studies as an independent major that combined architecture and urban studies with history and philosophy. She received her Master of Architecture degree from Princeton University and after two years practicing with Rem Koolhaas in the Netherlands, she returned to school to obtain her Ph.D. in Architectural History, Theory and Criticism from MIT.\\n\\nThis, Not That invites thought-provoking speakers to present arguments for their respective positions, or ideological stances, toward the design of the built environment. Their arguments will be supported by presentations of their creative efforts in research, pedagogy or professional practice.  This series stages an ongoing debate around the shifting perspectives that frame creative practice.Perloff Hall is located on the UCLA Campus.\\n\\nFREE\\nPerloff Hall, M-F, 9am \\u2013 5pm\\nInfo: 310.267.4704\\nLectures take place at 6:30pm in Perloff Hall Decaf\\xe9 (unless otherwise indicated)\\nParking is available in Lot 3 for $12, purchase parking at the Westholme Ave and Hilgard Ave kiosk.\\nCheck the website for confirmation of all programs at www.aud.ucla.edu\\ufffd\\nThe campus map is available at www.aud.ucla.edu/map',\n",

Stirr examines how forms of love and intimacy are linked to changing conceptions of political solidarity and forms of belonging, through the lens of Nepali dohori song. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe book describes dohori: improvised, dialogic singing, in which a witty repartee of exchanges is based on poetic couplets with a fixed rhyme scheme, often backed by instrumental music and accompanying dance, performed between men and women, with a primary focus on romantic love. This talk will address how urban dohori performances strive to recreate rural performance spaces with a cosmopolitan flair. It will address how performers negotiate issues of honor, in part by relying on rural, indigenous paradigms of social exchange and their associated aesthetics of verbal art and musical sound.',\n",

This twenty-panel installation interrogates the theme of feminism in the context of southern Africa, and considers the consequences of dividing labor practices by gender.\\n\\nMokgosi\\u2019s approach to storytelling through the form of history painting allows us to compare what we see in the paintings to the realities of inequality and gendered labor division we know from experience. This approach to the content also inspires us to think expansively about politics, power structures, and the role of history in the creation of the current nations of southern Africa.\\n\\nDetails at bit.ly/2G5N9GM',\n",
