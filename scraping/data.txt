The book describes dohori: improvised, dialogic singing, in which a witty repartee of exchanges is based on poetic couplets with a fixed rhyme scheme, often backed by instrumental music and accompanying dance, performed between men and women, with a primary focus on romantic love.\nThis talk will address how urban dohori performances strive to recreate rural performance spaces with a cosmopolitan flair. It will address how performers negotiate issues of honor, in part by relying on rural, indigenous paradigms of social exchange and their associated aesthetics of verbal art and musical sound.",

Errol Flynn cemented his stardom\u2014first realized with Curtiz in Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade\u2014by becoming the charming brigand who fights evil Prince John (Claude Rains) and Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone), while wooing the lovely Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland). Curtiz shares directorial honors with William Keighley after taking over the picture in the middle of production.  One of the great film scores by Erich Wolfgang Korngold accentuates a lavish production by Hal Wallis and Henry Blanke.  Also starring Patric Knowles, Eugene Pallette, Alan Hale and Melville Cooper.\nDirectors: Michael Curtiz, William Keighley. Cast: Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains, Patric Knowles.\n35mm, Technicolor, 102 min.\nFollowed by: \nThe Case of the Curious Bride (1935)\nErrol Flynn\u2019s American film debut (in a pair of brief appearances) is a postscript to a rapidly paced Perry Mason mystery that is as amusing as it is clever.  Warren William stars as a gastronomically inclined Mason who dines at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf with his factotum Spudsy (Allen Jenkins) and coroner pal (Olin Howland), before attempting to unravel his discovery of a corpse (Flynn) while aiding a damsel in distress.  Curtiz sets a breakneck pace of quick transitions and dissolves in the most entertaining of the six Warner Bros. Mason films adapted from Erle Stanley Gardner\u2019s novels.\nDirector: Michael Curtiz.  Producer: Harry Joe Brown.

In 1973, David Harrington was inspired to form Kronos after hearing George Crumb\u2019s Black Angels, a highly unorthodox, Vietnam War-inspired work featuring bowed water glasses, spoken word passages and electronic effects.\nKronos revisits the inspiration for the founding of the group with My Lai. The infamous 1968 massacre of unarmed Vietnamese villagers by American soldiers provides the context for this gripping new work written by composer Jonathan Berger and librettist Harriet Scott Chessman for the Kronos Quartet, tenor Rinde Eckert and Vietnamese multi-instrumentalist V\u00e2n-\u00c1nh V\u00f5.\nMy Lai, which features traditional Vietnamese instruments and digitally processed sounds, is told from the perspective of the heroic helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson who tried to stop the slaughter and was vilified for reporting it.",

This exhibition is the most comprehensive presentation of Bahian arts to date in the U.S., and features the work of such modernists as M\u00e1rio Cravo Neto, Rubem Valentim, and Pierre Verger, as well as contemporary artists Rommulo Vieira Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Caetano Dias, Helemoz\u00e3o, Ayrson Her\u00e1clito, and others.\nAx\u00e9 Bahia features more than 100 works from the mid-20th century to the present, including a stunning array of sculpture, painting, photography, video, and installation art. While adding to popular understandings of core expressions of African heritage such as the religion Candombl\u00e9, the exhibition explores the complexities of race and cultural affiliation in Brazil, and the provoca-tive ways in which artists have experienced and responded creatively to prevailing realities of Afro-Brazilian identity in Bahia.",

It tells the story of a South African university professor (John Malkovich) who moves to his daughter's Eastern Cape farm when his affair with a student costs him his position.\nMeleko Mokgosi Film Series In conjunction with Bread, Butter, and Power, artist Meleko Mokgosi has selected films addressing colonialism, democracy, and liberation across the continent of Africa, themes that he explores through his large-scale episodic painting cycles.\nAbout the Exhibition Meleko Mokgosi\u2019s large-scale episodic painting cycle Bread, Butter, and Power forms the newest chapter in his ongoing series Democratic Intuition, which seeks to explore ideas about the many ways that democratic concepts influence our lives, loves, and relationships on macro- and micro-levels. This twenty-panel installation interrogates the theme of feminism in the context of southern Africa, and considers the consequences of dividing labor practices by gender.\nMokgosi\u2019s approach to storytelling through the form of history painting allows us to compare what we see in the paintings to the realities of inequality and gendered labor division we know from experience. This approach to the content also inspires us to think expansively about politics, power structures, and the role of history in the creation of the current nations of southern Africa.",

Then bring their bodies home to your basement and arrange them in charming domestic tableaux!  Utilizing the same innovative makeup and saturated lightning styles so showcased in her Untitled Film Stills series, Sherman brings her rich sensibility to the big screen for a film now considered a cult classic.  In a sick but somewhat intentional coincidence, this underappreciated final inclusion in our series was once distributed by Miramax. \nDirector: Cindy Sherman.
