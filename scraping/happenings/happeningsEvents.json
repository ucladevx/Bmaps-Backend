The book describes dohori: improvised, dialogic singing, in which a witty repartee of exchanges is based on poetic couplets with a fixed rhyme scheme, often backed by instrumental music and accompanying dance, performed between men and women, with a primary focus on romantic love.\nThis talk will address how urban dohori performances strive to recreate rural performance spaces with a cosmopolitan flair. It will address how performers negotiate issues of honor, in part by relying on rural, indigenous paradigms of social exchange and their associated aesthetics of verbal art and musical sound.",

Curtiz shares directorial honors with William Keighley after taking over the picture in the middle of production.  One of the great film scores by Erich Wolfgang Korngold accentuates a lavish production by Hal Wallis and Henry Blanke.  Also starring Patric Knowles, Eugene Pallette, Alan Hale and Melville Cooper.\nDirectors: Michael Curtiz, William Keighley.

Warren William stars as a gastronomically inclined Mason who dines at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf with his factotum Spudsy (Allen Jenkins) and coroner pal (Olin Howland), before attempting to unravel his discovery of a corpse (Flynn) while aiding a damsel in distress.

It tells the story of a South African university professor (John Malkovich) who moves to his daughter's Eastern Cape farm when his affair with a student costs him his position.\nMeleko Mokgosi Film Series In conjunction with Bread, Butter, and Power, artist Meleko Mokgosi has selected films addressing colonialism, democracy, and liberation across the continent of Africa, themes that he explores through his large-scale episodic painting cycles.\nAbout the Exhibition Meleko Mokgosi\u2019s large-scale episodic painting cycle Bread, Butter, and Power forms the newest chapter in his ongoing series Democratic Intuition, which seeks to explore ideas about the many ways that democratic concepts influence our lives, loves, and relationships on macro- and micro-levels. This twenty-panel installation interrogates the theme of feminism in the context of southern Africa, and considers the consequences of dividing labor practices by gender.\nMokgosi\u2019s approach to storytelling through the form of history painting allows us to compare what we see in the paintings to the realities of inequality and gendered labor division we know from experience. This approach to the content also inspires us to think expansively about politics, power structures, and the role of history in the creation of the current nations of southern Africa.",

Then bring their bodies home to your basement and arrange them in charming domestic tableaux!

In a sick but somewhat intentional coincidence, this underappreciated final inclusion in our series was once distributed by Miramax. \nDirector: Cindy Sherman.
