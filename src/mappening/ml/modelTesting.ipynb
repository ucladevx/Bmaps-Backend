       "  u'description': u'Concert & Talk\\nTerra-cotta warriors, high-profile buildings beneath tomb mounds, and bronze chariots, horses, and water fowl are among the iconic artifacts and images associated with China\\u2019s first imperial dynasty, the Qin (221\\u2013206 BCE). Distinguished archaeologist Duan Qingbo, from Northwest University\\'s School of Cultural Heritage in Xi\\u2019an, China, shares new research suggesting that the roots of Qin culture may not be solely indigenous Chinese. Evidence now suggests that influences from Persia\\u2019s Achaemenid Dynasty (550\\u2013330 BCE) and from the empires of Alexander the Great and his successors may have come to China along Central Asian trading networks and impacted the development of the Qin\\u2019s material culture and social governance.\\n\\nThe program will begin with a concert of Chinese and Persian music performed by UCLA Department of Ethnomusicology faculty Li Qi (Director, Music of China Ensemble) and Amir Pourjavady (Director, Music of Persia Ensemble), with an introduction by Professor Helen Rees. Following the program, a hosted reception will be held on the museum\\u2019s Barbara and Joseph Goldenberg Terrace.\\n\\nRSVP using the \"Get Tickets\" button above. \\n\\nHosted by UCLA Cotsen Institute for Archaeology faculty Professor Lothar Von Falkenhausen (Department of Art History and Associate Director, Cotsen Institute) and Associate Professor Li Min (Department of Anthropology and Department of Asian Languages and Cultures).\\n\\nPresented at the Fowler Museum in partnership with UCLA Cotsen Institute for Archaeology, UCLA Department of Ethnomusicology, the Boethius Initiative, and the UCLA Confucius Institute.\\n\\nThis program is part of Visioning Dunhuang, a multi-year exploration of two millennia of creative and spiritual cross-cultural exchange along Afro-Eurasian trade routes, newly reflected in globalized contemporary Los Angeles.\\n\\n--\\n\\nParking available in UCLA Lot 4, 398 Westwood Plaza, directly off Sunset Blvd | $12/day\\n\\nImage: Terra-cotta warriors, Xi\\u2019an, China.

Admired for his versatility, his compositions include art songs, chamber and choral music, concertos, large ensemble works, and songs for musical theater. View From a Hill: Mark Carlson at 65, presented on the composer\\u2019s 65th year, features movements and songs that span his entire career, offering a glimpse into how his music evolved as a composer. He also gives us a peek into the future as he presents an aria from his opera on The Scarlet Letter, which he is currently writing with librettist Bruce Olstad, also a UCLA alumnus. Fittingly, the roster of performers on the program is exclusively Herb Alpert School of Music students, faculty, alumni and staff. \\u201cI have spent most of my adult life at UCLA, and my output as a composer is intimately linked with and has been nurtured in so many ways by my life at UCLA,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nFree Admission!\\n\\nProgram includes:\\n\\nBatik, The Homeward Heart (mvt 2) (2010)\\nThis is the Garden (songs 1 & 2) (1987)\\nThe Scarlet Letter, Hester\\u2019s Plea (2016)\\nEntre la sombra y el alma (2007)\\nCuatro sonetos de amor (songs 2 & 3) (1998)\\nFrom One Who Stays (songs 3 & 5) (1992)\\nView From a Hilltop (mvts. 3 & 2) (2009)\\nTwo pieces on speeches by John F.

       "  u'description': u\"The 7th Annual Southeast Asian Transfer Enrichment Day (SEATED) staff applications are out! You don\\u2019t have to be a transfer to staff, just apply to show love to our transfer bruins!\\n\\nApplication: https://goo.gl/forms/iE0nBwmSUQewD49z2\\n\\n***APPLICATION DEADLINES***\\nCo-chairs: Sunday, March 11th, at 11:59PM\\nCoordinators, Peer Mentors, and Facilitators: Friday, March 16th, at 11:59 PM.\\n______________________________________________\\n\\nSEATED: What is it?\\nBeginning in 2012, Southeast Asian Transfer Enrichment Day (SEATED) was established by the Southeast Asian student groups at UCLA to plan a one day event dedicated to newly admitted transfer students. The event aims to introduce students to the wide range of transfer resources available as well as to the community of support established here at UCLA.\\n\\nWhy is SEATED important?\\nThe Southeast Asian student groups recognize the unique experience of the Southeast Asian transfer students. Upon arrival in UCLA, Southeast Asian transfer students, in addition to the model minority myth, have difficulties exploring the vast number of relevant resources within the two years. Also, because of the limited time, these students have difficulties finding a home within UCLA to be able to share their unique experiences with.\\n\\nServe the Southeast Asian transfer community while developing your leadership skills, exploring your identity, and forming a connection with a group of highly motivated individuals!\\n\\nSoutheast Asian Transfer Enrichment Day (SEATED) is held in collaboration by Southeast Asian Student Organizations at UCLA, including the Burmese Student Association, Thai Student Association, Vietnamese Student Union, United Khmer Students, the Association of Hmong Students, the Asian Pacific Coalition, and the Southeast Asian Campus Learning Education. SEATED seeks to promote higher education, increase community consciousness, and provide a safe and supportive Southeast Asian community on campus, while introducing Southeast Asian admits to the vast variety of opportunities and resources available at UCLA.\\n\\nThis is a day-long event that will be held on May 11th, the day before Transfer Bruin Day. The program consists of workshops, tours, student/alumni panelists keynote speakers, and more. Prospective students will have a chance to experience student life at UCLA as Southeast Asian Transfer students. They will be welcomed to a family of highly motivated students who have a passion for serving the Southeast Asian community.  \\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to allow students to experience what it might be like to be a UCLA transfer student in a supportive Southeast Asian community and build the next generation of empowered student leaders. A student initiated and student run event such as SEATED would not be possible without your help! \\n\\nIf you have any questions regarding the application, please contact the co-chairs at getseated@gmail.com. Thank you! We look forward to working with you. \\n\\n______________________________________________\\n\\nCO-CHAIR\\n\\nAs a co-chair you are expected to be familiar with planning an event of this type or scale.

       "  u'description': u\"UCLA Bruin Run/Walk is back with the 19th annual 5K benefiting the Chase Child Life Program at the Mattel Children\\u2019s Hospital at UCLA. Support us in this cause, \\u201cRun with Purpose, Join the Run/Walk Circus\\u201d.   \\n\\nBruin Run/Walk is one of twelve committees within UCLA's USAC Student Wellness Commission (SWC). We are responsible for organizing one of the biggest student-run events on campus every year: a 5K in the spring that benefits the Chase Child Life Program at the Mattel Children\\u2019s Hospital at UCLA. It brings together students, UCLA faculty, and members of the greater LA community for a wonderful cause.\\n\\nThe Mattel Children\\u2019s Hospital UCLA Chase Child Life Program was established in 1968 in recognition of the unique needs of its pediatric patients, who were critically and chronically ill. This program was one of the first in the nation, and has served as a model for other medical centers to follow. A commitment to the continuity of the care of its patients and a highly developed volunteer program are two facets that distinguish the program from others.\\n\\nThe Chase Child Life Program supports the entire families of its pediatric patients by helping the children, adolescents, and their siblings acclimate to the healthcare environment. Child Life Specialists work with these long term and chronically ill patients by using play time and education to help them cope through life's stressful events.\\n\\nThe Annual Bruin Run/Walk 5K has been a tradition on the UCLA campus for over 18 years. Last year, we had gathered more than 1000 run/walk participants and were able to raise over $75,000 for the Chase Child Life Program. Thirty-two passionate UCLA undergraduate students make this event possible in close coordination with the Mattel Children\\u2019s Hospital.\\n\\nVisit www.bruinrunwalk.com for more details on registration. Early bird registration fees are $25 and will go up to $30 on April, 14, 2018! UCLA students are eligible for a $5 discount off registration. All proceeds from the race will go directly towards the Chase Child Life Program. \\n\\nThis is great way to fulfill most of our healthy new year\\u2019s resolution but more importantly make a positive impact on the children. Sign up today!\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFollow us on our social media accounts for more information about this event!\\n\\nLike on us FACEBOOK: UCLA Bruin Run/Walk\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BruinRunWalk/\\n \\nor\\n\\nDo it for the \\u2018GRAM (INSTAGRAM) with us: @BruinRunWalk\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bruinrunwalk/\\n\\nor \\n\\nTweet us at TWITTER: @BruinRunWalk\\nhttps://twitter.com/BruinRunWalk\",\n",

       "  u'description': u'Since the 1980s, nearly 150,000 people of Oaxacan ancestry have migrated to California. One way they have maintained cultural ties to their homeland is by playing the traditional game pelota mixteca or Mixtec-style ball. Moderated by Chief Curator Matthew H. Robb, this talk examines the origins of these games in ancient Mesoamerica and their popularity today. Panelists include artist Leopoldo Pe\\xf1a; Dr. Gaspar Rivera-Salgado, UCLA Center for Labor Research; and Fidel Salazar Rosales, President of AJDATEO (Asociaci\\xf3n de Juegos y Deportes Aut\\xf3ctonos y Tradicionales del Estado de Oaxaca).\\n\\nFollowing the discussion, enjoy refreshments and a 3:30pm demonstration game of pelota mixteca on Wilson Plaza.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nParking available in UCLA Lot 4, 398 Westwood Plaza, directly off Sunset Blvd | $12/day\\n\\nAbout the Exhibition\\nA longtime resident of Los Angeles, Leopoldo Pe\\xf1a makes photographic works that center on themes of immigration and the environment. Pelotas Oaxaque\\xf1as / Oaxacan Ball Games: Photographs by Leopoldo Pe\\xf1a features black-and-white images of traditional ball games played by Oaxacan expatriates throughout Southern and Central California. Pe\\xf1a\\u2019s photographs capture discrete moments\\u2014arms reaching toward the ball; pauses in action as players gather their strength; families and friends watching the game from the sidelines\\u2014and in so doing document how the game creates and reinforces communal ties.',\n",

Hailing from the Soviet Union, the former child prodigy has a tone that \\u201cvaries from a beautiful, singing lyricism to a more matter-of-fact solidity,\\u201d said the Times-Picayune. Following her debut at Alice Tully Hall, the New York Times said, \\u201cThe qualities she prizes most are clarity of line and transparency of texture.\\u201d UCLA Piano Students will have a rare post-recital opportunity to get advice from one of the best in this mini-recital and masterclass.\\n\\nFree Admission!\\n\\nParking for Jan Popper Theater is in UCLA Parking Structure 2.\\n\\nThis event is made possible thanks to a gift from Barbara Abell who established the David L. Abell Piano Masters Series in honor of her late husband. Pianos were a passion for David, the owner of David L. Abell's Fine Pianos in Los Angeles, which became a hot-spot for musical legends such as Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, Andre Previn, George Shearing, Bob Hope, Tony Bennett and Benny Carter. We are proud to celebrate this program as part of the 2017-18 David L. Abell Piano Master Series.\",\n",

According to Felipe \\u201cthere were many supportive student organizations with a lot of energy and creativity and professors who were open for guest speakers and even gave their students academic credit for community projects but just as important is our understanding that a lot of economic and social policy is born in universities and often legislator call on them for advice.\\u201d  \\n\\nThe parents of the 43 students are relying on an Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts \\n(GIEI website.) created by the Inter-American commission on Human Rights that investigated what happened to their 43 missing sons, to pressure the Mexican government that has been grossly negligent and ineffective in handling the case.',\n",

Ostensibly labeled \"The Dark Boys\" because of their dark skin, they sought a community where brothers could thrive in a kinship guided by the principles of intellectual awareness, social responsibility, personal integrity, and brotherly love. In May of the same year, these seventeen founding fathers united to create The Dark Boys, reclaiming the label as their own. In the spirit of true brotherhood, and in jest, the brothers adopted the first letters of The Dark Boys, TDB, and quasi-translated them into the Greek letters: Theta, Delta, and Beta, to mimic the traditional Greek system.\\n\\nGamma Chapter Los Angeles was founded in 1994. Theta Delta Beta cultivates and celebrates the intellectual, imaginative, and humanitarian promise of each brother and sister in a family that seeks to practice mutual respect, embrace diversity, and encourage education. Gamma Chapter also has a Lil Sis Program which only expands our meaning of family.\\n_____________________________\\n\\nTheta Delta Beta Chapters\\n\\u0391 \\u2013 University of California, Irvine\\n\\u0392 \\u2013 California State University, Fullerton\\n\\u0394 \\u2013 California State University, Long Beach\\n\\u0395 \\u2013 California State University, Pomona\\n\\n\\u0393 \\u2013 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nQuestions or concerns?

(an acronym for Does Real Ass Music) and his family planted roots in Hampton, Virginia, where he was raised. Growing up, he hung around his older cousins and found inspiration in artists beyond his years, such as luminaries like Al Green and Parliament. \"As a kid, I remember everyone in my family played older music, it just rubbed off. It was a blessing,\" he says. With the release of his debut album \\'Big Baby D.R.A.M.,\\' D.R.A.M. is more determined than ever to prove that he is here to stay. Heralded by the double platinum, Lil Yachty-assisted \"Broccoli,\" which hit #1 on the Billboard \"Top Rap Songs\" chart, as well as #1 on the Rhythmic radio charts, \\'Big Baby D.R.A.M.\\' is filled with an assorted mix of soulful jams, laced with appearances from Erykah Badu and Young Thug, that are all tied together by D.R.A.M.\\'s magnetic personality. \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTommy Genesis (Opener)\\nRapper and visual artist Tommy Genesis first shook attention last year when she was signed by Atlanta\\u2019s cult rap king Father to Awful Records \\u2014 an independent label and community of DIY artists that cater to deep-web, Soundcloud nerds across the globe. After clocking her music online, Father started asking her to collaborate by leaving voicemails telling Tommy to \\u201cget her shit together\\u201d. Eventually, the Vancouver-born musician listened, and injected her undeniable talents into Father\\u2019s bleary-eyed rap jam \\u201cVamp\\u201d, her verse a clear, soft-voiced antidote to Father\\u2019s monotone drawl. Tommy\\u2019s first official Awful Release, her debut album World Vision, further confirmed the creative polymath as one to watch. Mixing a heady dose of ATL trap influences with a smoother, Lauryn Hill-style flow, her sound is unique yet uncanny.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWe will start wristbanding for people that have reservations from 5:30-7:30, doors at 8:00, standby will begin at 8:00, doors will officially close at 9:30.

For Weeks 4-5 (including The Clothesline Display and Take Back the Night) see https://www.facebook.com/events/1736314493318925/. Thank you!\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1 in 3 women, 1 in 6 men, and 1 in 2 trans folk will experience sexual assault over the course of their lifetime.\\n\\nMore than 4 of every 5 cases reported are perpetrated by someone known to the survivor.\\n\\nThese are just a few of many sobering sexual assault statistics. Although sexual violence is an issue that\\u2019s gained plenty of attention in recent years, it\\u2019s important to know there\\u2019s still much room for learning and improvement. \\n\\nSo if this cause is important to you, you\\u2019ll be excited to know April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. We at Bruin Consent Coalition have tons of wonderful and educational events planned for you, ranging from events addressing sexual violence in the undocumented community to the 20th anniversary of The Clothesline Display, a silent protest and arts activism project in Dixon Courts. So come out and join us it\\u2019ll be awesome!\\n\\nAlso we\\u2019ve got new T-shirts and tons of FREE SWAG(!!!) so don\\u2019t hesitate to say hi to us at events or if you catch us tabling :)\\n\\nSAAM Kickoff\\nApril 4, 10a-2p\\nBruin Walk\\nFind us on Bruin Walk selling succulents (with FREE POTS) to raise funds for the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center, which provides awesome resources and services for survivors of sexual assault.\\n\\nBrave Space: Reclaiming Yellow Fever - Breaking Down Harmful Stereotypes\\nApril 4, 7p\\nNorthwest Campus Auditorium\\nThrough this event, we hope to provide a safe space for students to discuss the hypersexualization of Asian women and the demasculinization of Asian men.  We hope to reclaim the term \"yellow fever\" that fails to see Asian women as individuals and instead fetishizes and reduces them to stereotypes. We also hope to shed light on harmful stereotypes of Asian women (i.e.The Orient, China Doll, Geisha Girl, Comfort Women) that are deeply rooted in a long history of sexual violence and exploitation.\\n\\nBridging Sexual Violence & the Undocumented Experience\\nWeds April 6, 5p\\nKerckhoff 133, 135\\nThis is the first event in our collaboration with IDEAS at UCLA, in which they will introduce the complexities that occur when sexual violence occurs in the undocumented community.\\n\\nUndocu-Healing from Sexual Trauma\\nThurs April 7, 6p\\nViewpoint Conference Room\\nIDEAS at UCLA and Bruin Consent Coalition are hosting a space to discuss the layering of trauma for sexual violence survivors who identify as part of the undocumented community, and possible paths for healing\\n\\nAddressing Assault in Academia\\nMon April 11, 6p\\nDodd 78\\nMembers of the UC Student Workers Union - UCLA (UAW 2865) Working Group on Sexual Harassment and Assault and the post-docs union (UAW 5810) will discuss organizing efforts and challenges confronting graduate students and postdocs how you can get involved.

Individuals will be able to explore the different cultural dynamics that influence these talks and experiences.\\n\\nClothesline Display\\nTues April 19 - Thurs April 21, 9a-4p\\nDixon Courts North + South\\nOver the past 20 years, survivors of sexual and gender-based violence in the UCLA community have decorated hundreds of t-shirts, each telling one survivor\\'s story. Each color t-shirt represents a different form of sexual or gender-based violence. The display is a silent protest for these survivors and will be up for three days during Week 4.\\n\\nTrauma-Informed Yoga\\nWeds April 20, 5:45p\\nKerckhoff 133, 135\\nNikita Gupta will lead one session of yoga, factoring in the healing process that occurs after trauma.\\n\\nTake Back the Night\\nThurs April 21, 6p\\nKerckhoff Grand Salon\\nAt the culmination of three days of the Clothesline Display, we will be providing a safe space for survivors of sexual assault to come forward and tell their stories.

We hope to educate the community about the LGBTQ spectrum and provide a safe space to discuss how experiences with sexual or gender-based violence may or may not affect one\\'s sexual lives.\\n\\nDenim Day\\nWeds April 27, 10a\\nMeyerhoff Park (Kerckhoff Lawn)\\nWe will lay jeans all across Meyerhoff Park, each pair decorated to raise awareness about sexual violence.\\n\\nSextravaganza\\nWeds April 27, 7p\\nCarnesale Palisades\\nSexperts, AIDS Awareness and Bruin Consent Coalition are just a few of many student organizations coming together to promote  sexual health.

The fruit of equanimity is wisdom, which then lends perspective to our relationships, our work, and our efforts of compassionate action.\\n\\nThe day will involve sessions of sitting meditation, movement meditation, discussions, lecture, Q&A, and breaks!\\n\\nNote: Please bring your lunch and water with you.\\n\\nAbout the Instructor:\\nSharon Salzberg is a central figure in the field of meditation, a world-renowned teacher and NY Times bestselling author.

The Technology Seminar - ROBOTIC CARTOGRAPHY and the Studio - BIO DYNAMIC ISLAND, led by Julia Koerner, investigate emergent technologies including 3D scanning, robotic video capturing and digital analysis of natural artifacts on micro and macro scales. Both literal and phenomenal investigations into natural systems and structures are part of the linked inductive courses. An exploration into various design media including bio-mimicry research and generative design morphology are included in the exhibition in the form of additive manufactured morphologies and CNC-fabricated scaled-up topologies. Animations, videos and VR simulations showcase ideas for architectural and urban applications for a small-scale pavilion to a large-scale urban design of an artificial Island in China - Hainan Island. Students propose the possibility of an absolute self-sustainable urbanism that can balance and integrate the aims of culture, nature and business to re-claim the importance of intelligent ecology as the advancement of 21st century urbanism. \\n\\nUCLA A.UD\\u2019s 2016-17 M.Arch.II program, SUPRASTUDIO will be led by Craig Hodgetts, Mark Mack, Thom Mayne, and Guvenc Ozel.\\n\\nInstructors for Summer Studio include: Benjamin Ennemoser, Julia Koerner, Steve Lee, Marta Nowak, Peter Vikar, and Eui- Sung Yi.',\n",

Into this world enters Clifford Bradshaw, a struggling American writer looking for inspiration for his next novel. On his first night in Berlin, Cliff wanders into the Kit Kat Klub, a seedy nightclub overseen by the strange, omniscient and gender-bending Master of Ceremonies, \\u201cthe Emcee.\\u201d Here, Cliff meets Sally Bowles, a vivacious cabaret performer, and an utterly lost soul. Sally and Cliff begin a relationship, which blossoms unexpectedly into a dream-like romance. As time passes, however, the situation in Berlin changes from exciting and vital to ominous and violent.\\n\\nDIRECTED BY Parker Whitlow\\nVOCAL DIRECTED BY Rebecca Wade\\nCHOREOGRAPHED BY Madellyn Christie\\n\\nPRODUCED BY Kiara Bryant and Amanda Faucher\\n\\nCAST:\\n\\nEmcee - Christian Giannini\\nSally Bowles - Marlena Becker\\nCliff Bradshaw - Austen Amparo\\nFraulein Schneider - Allison Cutshall\\nHerr Schultz - Jake Garberg\\nErnst Ludwig - Sam Brogadir\\nFraulein Kost - Noga Tour\\nBobby - Ryan Chen\\nVictor - Braulio Sepulveda\\nHans - Braylon Camper\\nHerman/ Max - Oscar Tsukayama\\nRosie - Natalie Hynes\\nLulu - Christina Hilliard\\nFrenchie - Maddy Lauritzen\\nTexas - Lois Nersesian\\nFritzie - Emily Allendorf\\nHelga - Erin Harris\\nKit Kat Girls - Morgan Hansen, Niki Jew, Sylvia Camacho, Danielle Jensen, Jelissa Sparks\\n\\n\\nPERFORMANCE DATES:\\nFriday, November 17 @ 8pm\\nSaturday, November 18 @ 2pm\\nSaturday, November 18 @ 8pm\\n\\nTickets are NOW on sale at CTO and they are FREE for UCLA students!

May Day has historically been a march for workers to speak up about their rights and about labor issues. The May Day march for this year is expected to draw thousands of people and organizations to resist the administration's attack on workers, unions, immigrants, Muslims, the LGBT community, women, people of color and sanctuary cities. This is a march that you definitely do not want to miss since it is expected to be one of the largest marches in May Day history!\\n\\nMay Day Bus Sign Up\\n\\nTo sign up for the bus please fill out this google form:\\n\\nhttp://bit.ly/LWS_MAYDAY17\\n\\nWe will be taking students to and from the march in Downtown LA. Students have the option to take the bus both ways or one way. We will leave promptly on  Monday, May 1st at 10:30 AM from the Campus Express Stop # 7/Murphy Hall Southbound and the march will begin at 12 PM. After the march, the buses will leave downtown (on 6th and Hill St.)  at 2:30 to return to UCLA. More information can be found on the google form above.\\n\\nMay Day Teach-In and I am a #Young Worker Update, Tuesday, April 25th 6PM- 8PM in Dodd 175\\n\\nIn preparation for May Day, International Workers Day, we will be hosting a teach-in. If you are curious about the history of May Day and you would like to learn more about this, come to the teach-in.  We will also be making posters for the May Day action.  Lastly, you will get the latest update on our Young Worker Project. \\n\\nThe I am a #YOUNGWORKER report is part of the UCLA Labor Center\\u2019s multimedia project that uses data, stories, and images, including documentary filmmaking, a photograph gallery, and stories from our online radio podcast by and for young people. It utilizes a social justice research lens that aims to center the experience and position of young workers and student researchers as experts. The goal of this multimedia project is to impact policies that will increase wages, and promote equality and mobility among young workers currently employed in low-wage service sector labor markets. There was a collection of over 550 surveys, 30 interviews, government data sources, and an extensive literature review.\\n\\nPosted are the flyer for both the May Day bus sign up and the teach-in. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Liz Espinoza at eespinoz@g.ucla.edu or at 562-659-9566.\\n\\nWe hope that you are able to attend these amazing and historic events!\",\n",

The Vietnamese Student Union (VSU) at UCLA is honored and proud to hold the 16th annual Black April commemoration event to remember the loss of our country 42 years ago. As a student organization, we value and acknowledge our past which has affected our present and will continue to influence our future. Since 2000, when it was first established, Black April has become one of the most important programs VSU holds. It allows our community to honor those who were directly involved in the war in addition to educating the younger generation on their cultural heritage. This year, Black April will not only focus on what happened during the war and the aftermath, but will also explore why we will and should always remember the Vietnam War. We will focus on why it is important for the younger generation to connect with their Vietnamese roots and how they can pass on their family narratives of this atrocity. We aim to bridge the cultural gap between the young and old and inspire generations of Vietnamese and Vietnamese Americans to look at the historical importance of the Fall of Saigon and the impact it has had on their lives at present. \\n\\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nPOSITIONS: \\n\\nCO-CHAIR: As a co-chair you are expected to be familiar with planning an event and meet several times weekly with staff.

This conference covers some major intersections between Jewish creativity and American opportunity.\\n\\nSeveral panels will highlight some key facets of the Jewish-American musical experience. In the great immigrant wave (1880s-1920s), Jews brought older and newer forms of sacred music, Yiddish folk, popular, and theater song, and wedding music of the klezmer. Assimilation accelerated change, with recent revitalization in our times. Stressing local roots, two panels will cover Hollywood topics. The morning panel will combine scholars and industry insiders to celebrate the work of the pioneering film composer Erich Korngold. In the evening Daniel Goldmark will chronicle the impact of the classic Al Jolson 1927 film, covering \\u201c100 Years of The Jazz Singer.\\u201d\\n\\nMONDAY, Nov. 6, 2017 | UCLA Luskin Conference Center\\n\\n9:00-9:15 Welcoming Remarks: Mark Kligman and Todd Presner\\n9:15-10:30 Session 1: Jews and the LA Music Industry\\nChair: David Lefkowitz (UCLA)\\nBryan Gilliam (Duke University) \\u201cErich Korngold\\u2019s Double Exile in Hollywood\\u201d\\nPanel Discussion with:\\nHolley Replogle-Wong (UCLA)\\nRichard Friedman (Richard Friedman Music, Inc.)\\nMichael Sigman (Writer and Media Consultant)\\n\\n10:45-11:30 Session 2: Acknowledgement of Lowell Milken Gift\\nSpeakers: Dean Judi Smith, Lowell Milken\\nJeff Janeczko (Milken Archive) \\u201cDiscovering a World of American Jewish Music: An Introduction to the Milken Archive\\u201d\\n\\n11:40-12:30 Session 3: Keynote Address\\nMark Slobin (Wesleyan) \\u201cJewish American Music: The Long View\\u201d\\n\\n12:30-2:00 Lunch Break*\\n\\n2:00-3:30 Session 4: Sacred Song and Music of the Past: Tradition and Innovation\\nChair: Steve Loza (UCLA)\\nJudah Cohen (Indiana University) \\u201cSinging Societies and Choral Music in the Nineteenth Century American Synagogue\\u201d\\nMark Kligman (UCLA) \\u201cThe Authenticity and Authority of Ashkenazic and Sephardic Traditions Brought to America\\u201d\\nWalter (Zev) Feldman \\u201cHuman Transmission and Musical Sources for Klezmer Music in America: ca. 1960-2000\\u201d\\nDiscussant: Lillian Wohl (UCLA)\\n\\n4:00-5:30 Session 5: Jewish Musical Interactions with Popular Media\\nChair: Robert Fink (UCLA)\\nDaniel Goldmark (Case Western University) \\u201cWhat Jewish Culture Sounded Like in Early 20th Century Media\\u201d\\nMitchell Morris (UCLA) \\u201cThe Three Jewish Lives of Sophie Tucker\\u201d\\nJosh Kun (USC) \\u201cThe Jewish Tinge of Latin American Musical Modernism in Los Angeles\\u201d\\n\\n6:00 Dinner Break\\n\\n7:30 \\u201c100 Years of The Jazz Singer\\u201d presentation by Daniel Goldmark (Case Western University)\\nChair: Raymond Knapp (UCLA)\\nThe Jazz Singer has consistently helped to define and redefine popular ideas about the sounds of Jewish culture and worship in Hollywood.

Based on a poem by Goethe, this symphonic poem was featured in Walt Disney\\u2019s \\u201cFantasia\\u201d and is often heard during the Halloween season.\\n\\nIntricate, gracious, and wistful, Strauss\\u2019 Duett Concertino was the last purely instrumental pieces the composer wrote and one of the only works conceived for the unusual combination of solo clarinet, solo bassoon, harp, and strings.\\n\\nWritten while Rachmaninoff was living in New York City in 1940, his Symphonic Dances combines an intense, brooding nostalgia for the composer\\u2019s native Russia with the glitter and exuberance of the Hollywood of the \\u201840s. Its first movement features two instruments not typically heard in prominent orchestral roles, the piano and alto saxophone. And again in the Halloween spirit, its last movement is based around the Latin Dies Irae!\\n\\nUCLA Philharmonia is thrilled to present Borist Allakhverdyan and Whitney Crockett.\\n\\nBoris Allakhverdyan is principal clarinet of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  He came to Los Angeles last year from his previous position as principal clarinet of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.  He is a founding member of the Prima Trio and is also the Grand Prize and Gold Medal winner of the 2007 Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition. Allakhverdyan tours internationally, performing at international festivals and leading master classes.  \\n\\nWhitney Crockett is principal bassoon of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Prior to his appointment in Los Angeles, he was principal bassoon of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. He has served on the faculties of the Julliard and Manhattan Schools of Music, McGill University in Montreal, and the Academie de Verbier in Switzerland.\\n\\nFun Fact:  Los Angeles Philharmonic principal flute and our soloists\\u2019 colleague Denis Bouriakov has recently joined the UCLA Music Department faculty as our flute professor.  \\n\\nThis concert was made possible by the David and Irmgard Dobrow Fund. Classical music was a passion of the Dobrows, who established a generous endowment at The UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music to make programs like this possible. The school is proud to celebrate this program as part of the 2017-18 Dobrow Series. \\n\\nParking for Schoenberg Hall is in Parking Structure 2.',\n",

Since its creation in 2005, the game has spread worldwide with over 500 teams in over thirty countries.\\n\\nHow do you play? Do you actually fly?\\nWe\\'ll go over all the rules at practice, but here are a few videos great for a quick introduction:\\nhttps://youtu.be/-71IIkHxZ3w\\nhttps://youtu.be/yX-I5E6POIY\\nhttps://youtu.be/d05ss2TbsBE\\n\\nAre these tryouts?\\nNope! UCLA Quidditch does not have \"tryouts\" per say. Everyone is welcome to come to our practices at any point. Competitive teams are picked later in the fall. Even if you are not interested in joining competitively, we encourage you to come try it out.\\n\\nWhat should I wear?\\nCome prepared to sweat. Quidditch is a lot of fun, but it\\'s also a workout! Dress comfortably, but leave your cape at home. Bring cleats if you have them, but no metal spikes.\\n\\nWhat should I bring?\\nContrary to popular belief, we are not BYOB (Bring your own broom). You don\\'t need to bring anything,  but it is recommended to bring some water and sunscreen.\\n\\nWhat if I\\'m not a fan of Harry Potter?\\nQuidditch has evolved into its own entity in recent years and is, for the most part, pretty far removed from the Harry Potter series. Quidditch is a competitive sport. Many people who have no interest in Harry Potter still love the game.',\n",

While serving to educate the community and bring culture into more people\\u2019s lives, VCN also brings together the members of the Vietnamese Student Union and other volunteers. VCN is a unique program that comprises of acting, traditional dance, modern dance, music, and behind-the-scenes work. The 200 students that partake in building this large-scale production foster bonds with each other and discover a sense of community. Involvement in a completely student-organized production allows skill development and personal growth. VCN is an especially great event to support because it aims to educate our audience while the students involved educate themselves and really grow through the retreats, rehearsals, and hours of practice.\\n\\nVIETNAMESE STUDENT UNION\\nThe Vietnamese Student Union (VSU) at UCLA chooses Martin Luther King Day, every year, to put on our Vietnamese Culture Night because it is a day of open minds and open hearts. Now in its 37th year, Vietnamese Culture Night has become one of the most anticipated events on campus, bringing together over 1,800 students, faculty, staff, family members and the off-campus Vietnamese American community annually. Culture night is a show produced by 150 students with a program cost of over $30,000, most of which goes to the cost of facilities.\\n\\nTopics in the past include:\\n\\u2022 Gambling\\n\\u2022 Undocumented students\\n\\u2022 Gang violence\\n\\u2022 Interracial marriage\\n\\u2022 Human trafficking\\n\\u2022 Mail-order brides\\n\\u2022 LGBT\\n\\u2022 Mental health & disability\\n\\u2022 The Fall of Saigon\\n\\u2022 Depression\\n\\u2022 Gender Inequity\\n\\n******************************\\nFOR MORE\\n******************************\\n\\nMissed out on previous VCNs?

Upon assuming office, the President repudiated the interrogation standards that had been authorized by his predecessor and emphasized U.S. compliance with international human rights obligations and the anti-torture norm. By contrast, President Obama authorized a marked expansion of the CIA and Pentagon's use of drones for surveillance and targeting. Some have argued that the expansion of the drone strikes will be one of the enduring foreign policy and national security legacies of the Obama administration. This half-day conference will interrogate that assessment as we approach the 2016 elections and enter the final weeks of the Obama presidency. The conference will include two panels, the first considering the administration\\u2019s drones policy from a national security perspective and the second evaluating the government\\u2019s drones program from the perspective of international humanitarian law.\\n\\nABOUT THE PANELS\\n\\nPANEL ONE: 10:00AM - 12:00PM\\n\\nGEN.

Coordinator and Facilitator). If you will be applying to multiple positions please submit a separate application for each position you are interested in (save your responses!) and note it in the comments of what you will be applying for.\\n\\nReminder, deadlines for each position are as follows:\\n\\nCO-CHAIR: DUE DEC. 16th, 2016 @ 11:59PM\\nCOORDINATOR: DUE JAN. 13th, 2017 @ 11:59PM\\nFACILITATOR: DUE JAN. 20th, 2017 @ 11:59PM\\nFAMILY HEAD: DUE JAN. 20th, 2017 @ 11:59PM\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSoutheast Asian (SEA) Admit Weekend is held in collaboration by Southeast Asian Student Organizations at UCLA, including the Vietnamese Student Union, United Khmer Students, Thai Smakom, and the Association of Hmong Students. SEA Admit Weekend seeks to promote higher education, increase community consciousness, and provide a safe and supportive Southeast Asian community on campus. In addition, we would also like to introduce Southeast Asian admits to the vast variety of opportunities and resources available at UCLA.\\n\\nThe four-day, three-night weekend will be taking place from April 13th-April 16th, 2017. The event includes workshops, a talent show, student/alumni panelists, and keynote speakers, as well as tours and a chance to experience student life with UCLA Housing and Dining. \\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to allow students to experience what it might be like to be a UCLA student in a supportive Southeast Asian community and build the next generation of empowered student leaders. An award-winning event like SEA Admit weekend would not be possible without its amazing Coordinators, Facilitators, and Family Heads, so please apply!\\n\\nIf you have any questions regarding the application or further information about each position, please contact Christine Pham at: seaadmit@gmail.com or cxqpham@gmail.com\\n\\nPlease indicate which type of position for which you will be applying and complete the form on the following page. If you want to to apply to different positions, please submit another response on the form with your additional interested position.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCO-CHAIR\\nAs a co-chair you are expected to be familiar with planning an event of this type or scale. You will meet several times weekly, including with staff, your fellow co-chairs, and with individual components/coordinators. In addition, you will also meet with UCLA officials and faculty during weekly meetings and outreach events. Upon meeting with fellow co-chairs, you will assist in planning and executing staff meetings as well as a retreat. You are a representative of the entire program itself. Since each co-chair will be meeting with, working with, and managing certain components (i.e., providing guidance), it is strongly preferred that co-chairs have had experience volunteering for SEA Admit or similar programs. Lastly, you must also be available the weekend of the event.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: All applicants are required to participate in an in-person interview to be scheduled upon submission of the application.\\n\\n*CO-CHAIR APPLICATIONS DUE DEC. 16th, 2016 @ 11:59PM\\n\\n\\nCOORDINATOR\\nGenerally speaking, coordinators should expect to spend a minimum of 6 hours a week on planning and development, of which 2 will be mandatory once a week at staff meetings. Coordinators and their Co-Coordinators (if applicable) are responsible for different aspects of the weekend like Food, Transportation, and Housing.  Certain Coordinators will be in charge of a committee (for example, Family Head and Workshops Coordinators work with sub-committees who apply through a separate application).  Coordinators meet at least once weekly with staff, and schedule separate meeting times with the co-chairs and their committees where applicable. Coordinators must be present the entire weekend and are expected to act as general volunteers throughout the program, especially if their coordinator responsibilities are complete by the beginning of the weekend (i.e. outreach, housing, fiscal, etc.). Coordinator position descriptions are on the following page. \\n\\n*COORDINATOR APPLICATIONS DUE JAN. 13th, 2017 @ 11:59PM\\n\\n\\nFACILITATOR\\nFacilitators work alongside their respective coordinators in regular meetings.

They will work alongside their respective coordinator to ensure that they are properly trained and prepared to assist the students.  They are expected to be generally knowledgeable about the UCLA campus, academic policies, student opportunities, Southeast-Asian-specific resources, and the purpose and mission of the Southeast Asian Admit Weekend. It is preferred, but not required, that family heads have had some volunteering experience with SEA Admit in the past, such as a facilitator, coordinator, etc. In addition, family heads who are at least second years are strongly preferred.\\n\\n*FAMILY HEAD APPLICATIONS DUE JAN. 20th, 2017 @ 11:59PM\\n\\n\\nPlease note that there may be a mandatory retreat for all staff during Winter Quarter.\\n\\nLINK: https://goo.gl/forms/GEVZnAeLpmM2W4Mc2',\n",

Participants will anonymously submit funny, embarrassing, gross, or scary stories. Or, talk about why they do or don\\u2019t have sex, why they love it, why they hate it, how to define sex. Everything and anything goes. Then, at the event, we will share some of these stories and facilitate discussion around these submissions.

On his first night in Berlin, Cliff wanders into the Kit Kat Klub, a seedy nightclub overseen by the strange, omniscient and gender-bending Master of Ceremonies, \\u201cthe Emcee.\\u201d Here, Cliff meets Sally Bowles, a vivacious cabaret performer, and an utterly lost soul. Sally and Cliff begin a relationship, which blossoms unexpectedly into a dream-like romance.

As we sympathize with the families who lost their loved ones, we are not able to fully picture the incident in its scale and relatability. The majority of the 304 were high school students who had hopes, ambitions, and dreams. Through this year\\u2019s Korean Culture Night, we delve deeper into the lives that were affected and bring to the stage a tragedy that shocked and angered our country.\\n\\n*********Discretion is Advised*********\\nKCN acknowledges that this year\\u2019s theme is a politically sensitive topic.  Due to its timely nature, we decided that it was appropriate to communicate the importance of how this tragedy affected the Korean/Korean-American Community.  \\n\\n**********Ticket Information**********\\nFor current UCLA Bruins, please refer to the UCLA Central Ticket Office starting Tuesday (4/11) and Wednesday (4/12) @10AM.  After you present your BruinCard, you will receive max 1 FREE tickets! Because of the success of last year\\u2019s production, this year we are distributing more tickets to UCLA students than previous years! There will be a line, so get there early and have your BruinCards ready!\\n\\nFor non-UCLA guests and KCN Alumni, please submit this form (https://goo.gl/ksJq1b).

Saving Hearts is a club that strives to prevent instances of Sudden Cardiac Arrest by providing free heart screenings to the youth in the greater Los Angeles area. Sudden Cardiac Arrest is an abnormality in the heart's electrical  system that can lead to sudden death, which is why between 5,000 - 7,000 youth die annually because of SCA. It's rated as the number one killer of student athletes and the number two killer of people under age 25. In order to successfully achieve our mission of saving lives and preventing SCA, we need to educate and continue spreading awareness throughout the community. The screenings only take 15 minutes so grab a friend, we look forward to seeing you soon!\\n\\nWHO: You, your friends, and the greater UCLA community\\nWHAT: FREE heart screenings to prevent instances of sudden cardiac arrest\\nWHEN: Saturday, March 11, 10am-2pm\\nWHERE: Ackerman Grand Ballroom\\nWHY: Sudden Cardiac Arrest is the #1 killer of student athletes and the #2 killer of people under age 25.

       "  u'description': u'Hi Bruins!\\n\\nAsians for Miracle Marrow Matches (A3M) will be coming to Bruinwalk to register people to join the Be The Match registry. This registry helps people in need of bone marrow donations find donations to help save their life. Every year, thousands of people are diagnosed with blood cancers, including many of your fellow Bruins. Together, we can fight these curable diseases!\\n\\nTo join be the match, you must:\\nBe between the ages of 18 and 44\\nMake a good faith commitment to donate if you are a match to anyone in need\\nMeet health eligibility guidelines \\nComplete paperwork\\nGet a swab on the inside of the cheek\\n\\nWho Needs Transplants?\\n\\nEvery year, more than 12,000 patients are diagnosed with life-threatening blood cancers \\u2013 like leukemia and lymphoma \\u2013 or other diseases for which a marrow or umbilical cord blood transplant from an unrelated donor may be their best or only hope of a cure.\\n\\nHow A Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplant Works:\\n\\nHealthy bone marrow and blood cells are needed to live. When a disease affects the bone marrow so that it cannot function properly, a bone marrow or cord blood transplant could be the best treatment option, and for some patients, offers the only potential cure.\\n\\nA bone marrow transplant involves collecting a donor\\u2019s healthy blood-forming cells and transfusing the donated cells, in a process that is similar to receiving blood or medicine through an intravenous (IV) catheter, or tube, into the patient\\u2019s bloodstream where they begin to grow and make healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.\\n\\nFinding A Match: The Basics\\nFor a successful transplant, a patient needs a matching donor. Seventy percent (70%) of the patients cannot find a matching donor within their family. These patients will depend on the Registry to help find them a donor. Special testing determines whether a patient and a donor are a good match\\n\\nRace And Ethnicity Matter\\nBecause the markers used in matching are inherited, patients are more likely to match someone from their own race or ethnicity. Adding more bone marrow donors and cord blood units from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds to the Be The Match Registry increases the likelihood that patients will find the match they need.\\n\\nSpecial thanks for Association of Chinese Americans, Hanoolim: Korean Cultural Awareness Group, UCLA USAC Office of the President, and Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches (A3M) for helping out for this drive.\\n\\nIf your org would also like to participate, please send me a message and we can add you!',\n",

There are 41.5 million people in these nations who need aid, of which 22 million are children. More than 1 million children have been affected by severe acute malnutrition and need to be admitted for treatment or risk irreversible impairments and death. Armed conflicts, along with droughts, displacements, water scarcity, and weak health, water, and sanitation systems have created a perfect storm for leaving millions hungry and sick. When a child is faced with malnutrition, they are at an increased risk for cholera, measles, and disease outbreaks; they are left out of school, and can suffer from severe diarrhea and dehydration. UNICEF is working to aid these children and families through providing nutrition, vaccines, clean water, education and more. \\n\\nCome out to UNICEF at UCLA's Hungry 4 Change event on May 25th in Dickson Court North from 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. to learn more about the crisis and how to help.

       "  u'description': u'BOOK TALK - Rubber Soldiers: The Forgotten Army that Saved the Allies in WWII\\n\\nGary and Rose Neeleman will present an overview of their new book, Rubber Soldiers: The Forgotten Army that Saved the Allies in WWII (Schiffer Publishing, 2017) at UCLA.\\n\\nAbout the book: \\nThe Rubber Soldiers were an army of 55,000 men from the Brazilian northeast, which were sent to the Amazon basin under an agreement between Brazilian strong man, Getulio Vargas, and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt to tap rubber for the Allied War effort. Approximately 26,000 of these men died in the Amazon of Malaria, Yellow Fever and other jungle afflictions. Many of the original tappers are still alive, now in their late 90\\'s and living in slums in major Amazonian cities, still awaiting compensation. Their descendants now populate major cities in the Amazon such as Porto Velho, Rio Branco and Manaus and these people have never been compensated for the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents. This book proves the United States did pay for the rubber contrary to common belief in Brazil that the US did not pay for the rubber. The air bases on the Brazilian northeastern coast were critical in defeating the Germans in North Africa and containing the German effort in the South Atlantic to take over Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina. The Allies lost 3500 ships to German U-boat attacks in the area and the Allies sunk 900 German submarines during the coarse of the war in the south Atlantic. This aspect of WWII has rarely been reported and yet it may have been one of the most important events of the war.\\n\\nAbout the Authors:\\nGary and Rose Neeleman\\'s history in Brazil dates back to the early 50\\'s when Gary served as a missionary for the LDS Church in the Brazilian interior. The couple later lived in Brazil for 7 more years, while Gary was a Correspondent for United Press International, and one of the very few foreign reporters at that time that spoke, read and wrote in the Portuguese language. Gary\\'s time in Brazil as a correspondent was not long after the close of WWII and a lot of his reporting had to do with the aftermath of the war in the South American countries. \\nFollowing 27 years with United Press International, Gary worked 17 years with the Los Angeles Times as vice president of international syndications. He was later a consultant in Latin America for the Washington Post Writers Group for 10 years.\\nFascinated with Brazilian history and culture, the couple wrote a best selling English language cookbook and later chronicled the construction of the building of an Amazonic railroad, \"Tracks in the Amazon\" from 1867-1913, which was awarded the best non-fiction book in Lain America, originally in Portuguese. The couple also wrpte\"Rubber Soldiers--the Forgotten Army that Savid the Allies in WWII\" and \"Stars and Bars beneath the Southern Cross--the story of the Confederate Migration to Brazil.\"\\nGary has served as the Honorary Brazilian Consul in Utah since 2002.\\n\\nFree and open to the public.\\n\\nFor more information and to RSVP please visit: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/book-talk-rubber-soldiers-the-forgotten-army-that-saved-the-allies-in-wwii-tickets-34484448915',\n",

HERE ARE SOME FAQS:\\n\\n*DO I HAVE TO GO TO ALL WORKSHOPS TO AUDITION?\\nNope~ pre-audition workshops are optional to get to know the directors and other members. Only one audition workshop is mandatory in order to audition, but both are recommended! \\n\\n*WHAT IS AN EXHIBITION TEAM?\\nThe team does not identify by skill level (beginner, intermediate, professional, competitive, etc). As an exhibition team, we have the same commitment (1 year) and intense training, drilling, cleaning, set-building, etc as any other teams. We have the same expectations to give 100% and to show improvement. The main difference is that we do not have a goal to win competitions or judge dancers based on skill. Rather, we look for a mindset of passion and thirst for growth. We look at philosphy, community, authenticity, and your determination to be the best you can be. \\n\\n*DOES ATLAS GO TO COMPETITIONS AND WHY?\\nYes. We go to compeititons for the sake of performing onstage together as a team, and look forward for the critiques given to us by the judges so that we can continue to grow. We don't aim to win, but to work towards toward putting what we have worked hard on together. We also perform at exhibition events.\\n\\n*ARE YOU ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS?\\nNope! We our own organization at UCLA that look for dancers who want to be on an exhibtion team.\\n\\n*WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS OF AN EXHIBITION TEAM?\\nWe go through the same training and set-building process as competitive teams, but with emphasis on training and individual growth. Atlas is a one year commitment. We also look for improvements from critiques, regardless of skill level. If you are not looking forward to practicing outside of rehearsal, then this is not the place for you.

In the constellation of exchanges between small-scale tinkerers, countercultural cooperatives, and Big Science that drove the \\u201clunatic fringe\\u201d of American solar research, architects and scientists reconceived indigenous construction as an environmental technology defined by the interplay between architecture and invisible energy forces.

We are responsible for putting on one of the biggest student-run events on campus every year: a 5K in the spring that benefits the Chase Child Life Program at the Mattel Children\\u2019s Hospital at UCLA. It brings together students, UCLA faculty, and members of the greater LA community for a wonderful cause.\\n\\nThe Mattel Children\\u2019s Hospital UCLA Chase Child Life Program was established in 1968 in recognition of the unique needs of its pediatric patients, whom were critically and chronically ill. This program was one of the first in the nation, and has served as a model for other medical centers to follow. A commitment to the continuity of the care of its patients and a highly developed volunteer program are two facets that distinguish the program from others.\\n\\nThe Chase Child Life Program supports the entire families of its pediatric patients by helping the children, adolescents, and their siblings acclimate to the healthcare environment. Child Life Specialists work with these long term and chronically ill patients by using play time and education to help them cope through life's stressful events.\\n\\nThe Annual Bruin Run/Walk 5K has been a tradition on the UCLA campus for over 17 years. Last year, we had around 850 participants for our event and were able to raise over $52,000 for the Chase Child Life Program. Our committee of 30 UCLA undergraduate students work closely together with the Mattel Children\\u2019s Hospital in order to make this event possible. \\n\\nThis year along with several other UCLA organization, we are teaming up with PlayFull. Download the app to play games and win rewards towards participating restaurants in Westwood Village. Be sure to eat out on our fundraising days, and a portion of your purchases at these restaurants will go directly towards the Chase Child Life Program.\\n\\nVisit www.bruinrunwalk.com for more details on registration.

The purpose of the conference is to strategize and plan our path forward, building up to a massive nationwide action beginning on Saturday, November 4.\\n\\nON NOVEMBER 4, 2017, we will take to the streets and public squares in cities and towns across the country, continuing day after day and night after night and not stopping until our demand is met: This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must Go! In the Name of Humanity, We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America.\\n\\nEvery day, the Trump/Pence Regime brings new outrages so extreme that they nearly wipe out all memory of countless previous outrages.\\n\\nBut behind the daily cycle of chaos, dysfunction and infighting, behind the idiotic tweets and propaganda, this regime is radically reorganizing our system of governance and politics, our culture, and our society, fundamentally transforming the United States into a fascist state.\\n \\nThere is only one force that can stop this catastrophe: us: we, the people \\u2013 all of us, acting together. On November 4 we will manifest the power of the people and take to the streets, and stay there, demanding that the entire regime must go.  Our actions will reflect the values of respect for all of humanity and the world we want\\u2014in stark contrast to the hatred and bigotry of the Trump/Pence fascist regime.\\n\\nIn past weeks, we have witnessed the Trump/Pence regime driving its fascist agenda ahead, with viciousness in the midst of conflicts and turmoil swirling around the White House. And as we\\u2019ve seen in recent days, they are even willing to bring us to the brink of nuclear war. All of this \\u2013 with good reason \\u2013 has heightened the anxiety and revulsion of millions who abhor everything this regime represents and the harm it is doing, and fear the danger that lies ahead if they remain in power any longer.\\n \\nWhatever issues you care about, realize that the Trump/Pence regime is on the wrong side of every single one of them. This is no exaggeration, and it\\u2019s no accident. It's fascism.\\n \\nSo join us. Refuse Fascism exists for one purpose and for one purpose only: to drive out the Trump/Pence regime. Any person, group, or organization is welcome, with the only requirement we unite around the basic demand that This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must Go! and the agreement that we need to organize masses of people to achieve this goal.\\n\\nYou can contact the Los Angeles chapter at (323) 946-1742 or SoCal@RefuseFascism.org\",\n",

Follow the enigmatic drifter Paul (ETHAN HAWKE) in this tarrantinoesque flicker. While running away from his war trauma towards Mexico through the vast desert of the Old West, his attempted shortcut through the former mining town Denton turns out as a wrong turn. When Paul gets into trouble with local troublemaker Gilly, his Dad (JOHN TRAVOLTA), tries to appease the two \\u2013 unsuccessfully. The only way to solve the tension between Paul and Denton is a spectacular and bloody shootout. In between, the protagonist flirts with the bubbly and charming daughter of the town\\u2019s Marshal, Mary-Anne (TAISSA FARMIGA). Don\\u2019t miss this as charming as sinister detour into the Wild Wild West with more than one touches of evil. Regular theatrical release: Oct 21.\\n\\nbrought to you by #GsaMelnitzMovies',\n",

If you're interested in joining the family system (voluntary) a survey will be going during Week 5 to gauge interest and influence what House you would will be placed into. \\n\\nThis year's family theme is Game of Thrones, so expect future socials to be more or less like the show (kidding). If you haven't watched Game of Thrones keep in mind that if you live on the Hill you can watch it for free via HBOGo! \\n\\n\\nFAMILY SYSTEM FAQ:\\n\\nBut what is the family system?\\n- The family system is a great way to meet new people, build friendships, and also ignite that sense of competition that may or may not be buried deep with you. \\n\\nCompetition?\\n- YES, you heard right! Decimate your enemies this year a la Game of Thrones fashion and leave them in the flames. Historically our club has fostered a friendly sense of competition amongs the families. The winning family at the end of the year gets a ~SPECIAL PRIZE~ for throwing down the gauntlet and defeating the other teams. \\n\\nWhat if I don't wanna compete?\\n- You don't need to be competitive to join a family, many members simply join the family system in order to hang out and overall just have a great time. \\n\\nCome on out and hang with us :D\",\n",

Shortened, we refer to the principles as friendship, sound learning and rectitude.\\n\\nHelping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person\\u2019s true self, and by learning from each other\\u2019s strengths while helping to improve each other\\u2019s weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his own. Rather than try to find young men to \\u201cmold\\u201d into some ideal, we celebrate the uniqueness of each individual and, through encouragement, values, example and brotherhood, empower every brother to exceed his personal expectations.\\n\\nSchedule of Events/info:\\nTaco Tuesday\\nTues Sept 26 4-8pm\\nMaster chef Alex Rivera recreates his delicious homemade Taco recipe for all to share.

Our project combines education, direct service, and reflection on social justice issues in both our own and outside communities. During spring break, undergraduate students travel to one of eight topic-driven sites across the United States and partner with community organizations to engage in direct service and reflect on their experiences. Students also engage in community service in the Los Angeles community before and after the trip to frame their experiences and give back to our community. We hope that students learn about intersectional social justice issues that they are interested in and have the opportunity to transform their short term service into a long term commitment. The funds raised from this event will go towards groceries, gas and other miscellaneous costs associated with our 8 trips during spring break.',\n",

Although vulnerable and  intimate, her portraits find strength in the commonality of difficult\\u2014and often unspoken\\u2014narratives. The complete show, \"Tear Drops & Three Dots,\" was on display at the Vincent Price Art Museum from February 27 - May 21, 2016. \\n\\nSTAR MONTANA is a photo-based artist who lives and works in Los Angeles, CA, and Brooklyn, NY.  She was born and raised in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East Los Angeles, which is predominantly Mexican American and serves as the backdrop to much of her work. Montana received her BFA from the School of Visual Arts in 2013.

This campaign is put on at UCLA by Best Buddies and Special Olympics with the help of the USAC Community Service Commission. It will take place over the course of 9th week of UCLA\\u2019s winter quarter.\\n \\nWHAT IS THE R-WORD?\\nThe r-word is \\u201cretard\\u201d or \\u201cretarded.\\u201d It comes from \\u201cmental retardation,\\u201d a term that used to be used medically to describe individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The term\\u2019s use gradually became derogatory, and it now is hurtful to entire communities of people. If someone uses the r-word as synonymous with \\u201cstupid\\u201d or in some way \\u201cbad,\\u201d then that person is equating those negative ideas with the millions of people worldwide who used to be identified by that word. There are plenty of words in the English language and plenty of other languages into which to branch out \\u2013 use a different word, and encourage those you know to do the same!\\n \\nWHAT IS THE \\u201cSPREAD THE WORD TO END THE WORD\\u201d CAMPAIGN, REALLY?\\nThe \\u201cSpread the Word to End the Word\\u201d campaign is a campaign to educate people about how hurtful the r-word is. It is also a vehicle for discussion. Many people do not know how to talk about disability, how to talk to someone they know has a disability, or how to treat the topic in general. It is the goal of this campaign to help people overcome these challenges and to understand IDD better.\\n \\nHOW CAN YOU BE INVOLVED?\\nCome out to one of our events! We will be in Bruin Plaza on Tuesday, March 1st, from 10am until 4pm, and we have a series of events throughout the week after that. Details on events are shown in the cover photo of this page.',\n",

Others house workshops. In some, cars are still kept. It is a closed male commune, a monastic brotherhood that includes retired blue- collar workers of a planned economy and engineers from factories closed in the course of neo-liberal reform. With the enthusiasm of alchemists, they are continuing to occupy themselves with inventing, constructing mechanical devices or re-soldering microcircuits pulled out of second-hand gadgets. \\n\\nThe kaleidoscopic complex of buildings is a hand-made cast of this peculiar microcosm. As the artists sawed, chopped and nailed together the prefabricated building materials of shantytown constructions, they used as a prototype the creative forms of vernacular architecture. Experiments with a physically approbated experience, \"knowing-in-action\" acquired through manual labour and the desire to decode, with self-made contraptions, the primal nature of industrial materiality represent an opportunity to confront themselves with the real as a given.\\n\\nPerloff Hall is located on the UCLA Campus.\\nPerloff Hall, M-F, 9am \\u2013 5pm\\nInfo: 310.267.4704\\n\\nLectures take place at 6:30pm in Perloff Hall Decaf\\xe9 (unless otherwise indicated)\\nParking is available in Lot 3 for $12, purchase parking at the Westholme Ave and Hilgard Ave kiosk.\\nAlternative parking is available at Self-Service Parking Pay Stations  \\nCheck the website for confirmation of all programs at www.aud.ucla.edu\\nThe campus map is available at www.maps.ucla.edu/campus/',\n",

However, we also pride in opening our doors to all majors that may be interested in research, health business, or simply broadening their horizons. Our chapter understands that the health world doesn't just need people who can do the job, but those that are refined in various other aspects. The resources offered allow our active members to strive for high academic standards, develop personal qualities, and refine professional skills. In no other place can this be found altogether.\\n\\nMISSION STATEMENT\\nThe brothers and sisters of Delta Epsilon Mu are committed to serving the community by advocating health education and care through active participation in service activities, fundraising and outreach programs. Members are given the opportunity to directly participate in health-oriented workshops and discussions, thereby attaining access to pertinent academic and career information through associations with professors, advisors, career professionals, alumni members and fellow active members.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\\n\\nPresident:\\nKelly Lam\\ndemuclapresident@gmail.com\\n\\nVice President of Recruitment:\\nNick Wu\\ndemuclavprecruitment@gmail.com\\n\\nFor more information, check out our website:\\nwww.ucladem.com\",\n",

So forget about the typical Chinese fast food restaurant because on May 4th, 4PM to 7PM at Bruin Plaza, we\\'re going to give you a taste of what REAL Chinese food is. There will be food from 8 Chinese restaurants, providing a variety of choices, such as \\u5c0f\\u9f99\\u867e (crayfish), \\u70e4\\u4e32 (meat skewers), Dim sum, \\u51c9\\u76ae (wheat or rice flour noodles), \\u8089\\u5939\\u998d (northern style meat sandwich), Grass jelly milk tea, Pineapple cake, and many more!\\n\\nTo purchase food, you can buy \"food passport\" coupons ($5, $10, and $15 types) at the gate to get food from booths. We accept cash, venmo, and credit card.\\n\\nThis event is intended to facilitate cultural exchange and provide an opportunity for all students and faculty to know more about Chinese cuisine, culture, and customs.',\n",

       "  u'description': u\"Hoarseness is a devastating loss, particularly for the performer or vocal professional. From musical theater actors to recording pop stars, vocal malfunction carries an elevated urgency for providers to return their patients to optimal voice quality. Likewise in non-performing professionals who critically depend on voice use, such as teachers, trial lawyers, or salespersons, a loss of voice quality can be equally devastating. Available published guidelines and information describing the treatment of hoarseness in this demanding subset of patients is extremely limited. \\n\\nWith the combined experience treating vocal professionals and performers, the multidisciplinary team of the UCLA Voice Center for Medicine and the Arts has developed an advanced multidisciplinary course that will teach and review diagnostic and treatment strategies for the hoarse performer and voice professional. The course will focus on incorporating all aspects of the voice team including presentations from the laryngology, speech pathology, and vocal pedagogy viewpoints as well as from the vocal performer's perspective.\\n\\nFor more information, please visit \\u27a8 http://ucla.in/2kNuuse\\n\\nRegister here \\u27a8 http://ucla.in/2kNoZtL\",\n",

Eligibility criteria for the Chancellor's team of current undergraduate and graduate students can be found on the Code for the Mission app competition details page. The final team of up to 5 (five) students will be selected through a screening process conducted by Startup UCLA with final approval from UCLA's Offices of Intellectual Property and Information Technology.\\n\\nChancellor Block's team and app are not eligible for any of the $5,000 Code for the Mission app competition prizes to be awarded on September 15. Instead, each team member will be awarded $1,000 per member (a maximum total of $5,000 to a team with 5 members) to develop the app over the course of the summer leading up to the Code for the Mission app competition submission deadline on August 31. (The $1,000 award will be divided into two payments of $500: the first payment will be dispensed in the last week of July 2016; the second payment dispensed in the last week of August 2016.)\\n\\nTeam up with the Chancellor is open to all current students, both undergraduate and graduate. Students with knowledge of and backgrounds in voice, language, and sound recognition and analysis are encouraged to apply. Because this is a project based upon intellectual property (IP) created by the Chancellor and students selected for the project will be compensated ($1,000 per student, maximum 5 students) for their efforts, any and all software or other IP created by the selected team for the purpose of this prize will be owned by UCLA. Please note that this is different from the University\\u2019s policies on ownership for student created IP (in most instances, everything that a student creates as part of a class [e.g. a paper, software, artwork] or on their own time is owned by the student). Students on the selected team are allowed and encouraged to list and describe whatever they create in their resume, portfolio, and elsewhere as a representation of their work. Depending upon what results in the future, students may be able to share in the project commercially.\\n\\nApplication deadline: May 1, 11:59 PM PST\\nInterviews with selected teams and individuals: May 4 \\u2013 11\\nChancellor\\u2019s team finalized and notified by: May 15\\n1st meeting with Chancellor: May 19\\n2nd meeting with Chancellor: July 26\\nDeadline for team to submit Chancellor's app: August 31, 5:00 PM PST\",\n",

At the same time, these prints represent \\u201cglobal Africa.\\u201d In every West African country, citizens express national distinction through the styles they create. In fact, each country has two different basic styles. The first, tracing its roots to the early twentieth century, is a variation on the three-piece ensemble of long wrap-skirt, top, and scarf. Each country claims its own version, and seamstresses create infinite variations\\u2014fitted or boxy, ruffled, ruched, or pleated, full or narrow sleeves\\u2014that go in and out of fashion. Of course, consumers and seamstresses are always adopting new fashion elements from other countries to enhance their own national outfits. The second style belongs to \\u201cglobal fashion,\\u201d and consists of trendy dresses, jackets, and pants. Here, too, there are both specific national styles and much cross-border exchange among fashion-conscious West and Central Africans.',\n",

This will have detrimental effects on the insurance market and is an irresponsible way to dismantle Obamacare. \\nThe tax plan additionally eliminates several tax credits available to students, and would tax tuition for graduate students, putting extreme burdens on graduate and PhD students who already earn little to no income.',\n",

This has led Sir to collaborate with legendary Composer Lee Musiker; who produced the likes of Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra Jr, but also collaborating on the track \\u201cFamiliar\\u201d with Chance the Rapper, King Louie and Quavo of Migos. Performing in finales with the Joffery Ballet, but then taking that same 8-piece horn section to rage venues with Travis Scott at Chicago\\u2019s renowned music venue, Metro. Sir has been featured by BET, the Chicago Tribune, Sway in the Morning, LA Weekly, Tidal, Spotify (\\u201cRaise Hell\\u201d hitting #1 on the Viral50 charts) and many more, but also has scored a Hollywood box office film \\u201cDysfunctional Friends\\u201d. One way to corner this guy is to say this is \\u201ccontemporary ghetto gospel\\u201d. A sound that you will be able to see live at most major music festivals this Summer and his leading single \\u201cRaise Hell,\\u201d from his forthcoming Atlantic Records release \\u201cPK: Preacher\\u2019s Kid.\\u201d\\n\\nAbout Marie Joxe:\\nMarie Joxe is an artist, designer and a visual storyteller.

The agency quickly secured top clients such as DIOR, OFFICIEL DE LA MODE, among others.\\n\\nMarie invested in a new adventure and founded a kid\\u2019s brand called POOKI AND CO.

       "  u'description': u'As one of the leading architects in Japan, Hiroshi Hara has produced major works that include Sapporo Dome, JR Kyoto Station Building, and Umeda Sky Building. Since the 1970s, he has spent over 25 years conducting extensive surveys of villages around the world. His architecture achievements along with his theoretical work on space are among many of his critical contributions to modern architecture. \\n\\nTrained at Tokyo University, Hara is one of the most accomplished in a new generation of avant-garde New Wave architects who became active beginning in the late 1960s and who were sharply critical of the contemporary urban developments in Japan.  Yet, unlike many of his more radical contemporaries, Hara derived his design theories from his extensive studies of vernacular architecture and indigenous settlements in Asia and Africa, in an attempt to bring cultural relevance to avant-garde ideas.  He follows a unique anthropological approach to architecture somewhat similar in nature to the one put forward by the members of Team Ten in Europe.\\n\\nHara\\u2019s early works, the so-called \\u201creflection houses,\\u201d such as his own residence at Machida near Tokyo and the Niramu House, Tokyo, display a negative attitude toward the chaotic and volatile conditions of the Japanese city and focus instead upon the internal order of the house as informed by critical aspects of dwelling.  They were all shaped along sequences of centrally and symmetrically arranged spaces and appeared as hollowed-out concavities.  Many of them implemented scaled-down and metaphorical urban elements, including landmarks, intersections and plazas, and so could be regarded as attempts to create miniature and fantastic cities.\\n\\nPerloff Hall is located on the UCLA Campus.\\ufffd\\nPerloff Hall, M-F, 9am \\u2013 5pm\\nInfo: 310.267.4704\\nLectures take place at 6:30pm in Perloff Hall Decaf\\xe9 (unless otherwise indicated)\\nParking is available in Lot 3 for $12, purchase parking at the Westholme Ave and Hilgard Ave kiosk.\\ufffd\\nAlternative parking is available at Self-Service Parking Pay Stations  \\ufffd\\nCheck the website for confirmation of all programs at www.aud.ucla.edu\\ufffd\\ufffd\\nThe campus map is available at www.maps.ucla.edu/campus/',\n",

His central focus, however, was the exploration of enduring continuities linking peoples and cultures of West Africa and the African Diaspora. Over the course of five decades, he took an estimated 65,000 photographs with his Rolleiflex camera, depicting individuals and groups in humanistic, light-drenched portraits. His approach to photography placed great emphasis on the beauty of the human form as encountered in scenes of everyday life.',\n",

Belittled at every turn, stubborn Li Xuelian, played by \\u201cduly de-glammed\\u201d (Variety) superstar Fan Bingbing, yet manages to flummox all the male government suits who cross her path in her decade-long, determined pursuit of justice. Intriguingly irised in round and square-shaped mats, I Am Not Madame Bovary nabbed the prestigious FIPRESCI prize and the top Golden Shell award respectively at the Toronto and San Sebasti\\xe1n film festivals, while Fan won Best Actress at San Sebasti\\xe1n for her portrayal of an ordinary woman of incomparable chutzpah.\\n\\n\\nCritics say\\n\\u201cThis sly comic parable, eccentrically tricked out in reductive screen formats (before finally \\u201cgoing wide\\u201d), is the tale of an \\u201cant\\u201d becoming an \\u201celephant,\\u201d one that fittingly strings a long series of small anecdotal sequences into a near-epic narrative arc.

The studio traveled to and engaged Panama City as a developing laboratory for architecture and its consequences in relation to jumbo and micro urban form. Instead of a Grand Tour consisting of a linear trajectory of many cities this studio took on an itinerary that was throughout and inside a single city. The studio visited the new ostentatious developments throughout Panama City as well as the local architects that designed them. \\n\\nThe production of the studio focused on the design of speculative towers for the complex urban collage that makes up Panama City. The main output of the studio was a very large model that served as the basis for the production of all representation. Students worked in pairs to produce 6 Tower Proposals, each based on architectural themes discovered during the visit to Panama City: 1) Twins 2) Icons 3) Feoclassical 4) Penthouses 5) City inside a City 6) Ruins.',\n",

       "  u'description': u'In memory of Yitzhak Rabin, Bruins for Israel will be on BruinWalk on Wednesday, November 16th from 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM. Come by and show us what peace looks like to YOU. \\n\\n\"We are embarking on a battle that has no dead and no wounded, no blood and no anguish. This is the only battle that is a pleasure to wage \\u2013 the battle for peace.\" -Yitzhak Rabin\\n\\nYitzhak Rabin was an Israeli politician, statesman and general. He was the fifth Prime Minister of Israel, serving two terms in office, 1974\\u201377 and 1992 until his assassination in 1995. Rabin was born in Jerusalem to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants and was raised in a Labor Zionist household. He learned agriculture in school and excelled as a student.He led a 27-year career as a soldier. As a teenager he joined the Palmach and eventually rose through its ranks to become its chief of operations during Israel\\'s War of Independence. He joined the newly formed Israel Defense Forces in late 1948 and continued to rise as a promising officer. He helped shape the training doctrine of the IDF in the early 1950s, and led the IDF\\'s Operations Directorate from 1959\\u20131963. He was appointed Chief of the General Staff in 1964 and oversaw Israel\\'s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War. Rabin served as Israel\\'s ambassador to the United States from 1968\\u20131973, during a period of deepening U.S.\\u2013Israel ties. He was appointed Prime Minister of Israel in 1974, after the resignation of Golda Meir. In his first term, Rabin signed the Sinai Interim Agreement and ordered the Entebbe raid. He resigned in 1977 in the wake of a financial scandal. Rabin was Israel\\'s minister of defense for much of the 1980s, including during the outbreak of the First Intifada. In 1992, Rabin was re-elected as prime minister on a platform embracing the Israeli\\u2013Palestinian peace process. He signed several historic agreements with the Palestinian leadership as part of the Oslo Accords. In 1994, Rabin won the Nobel Peace Prize together with long-time political rival Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Rabin also signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. In November 1995, he was assassinated by an extremist named Yigal Amir, who opposed the terms of the Oslo Accords.\\n\\nRabin was the first native-born prime minister of Israel, the only prime minister to be assassinated and the second to die in office after Levi Eshkol, and has become a symbol of the Israeli\\u2013Palestinian peace process.',\n",
