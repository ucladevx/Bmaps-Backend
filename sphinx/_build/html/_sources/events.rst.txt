Events
======

Welcome to the Mappening Events API! Through a RESTful interface, this API provides information on all the events happening around UCLA. The simplest way to access this data is to go to the url `whatsmappening.io/api/v1/events <https://whatsmappening.io/api/v1/events>`_ to get a comprehensive listing of all upcoming UCLA events. See the explanation of |event| objects below. The Events API offers various ways to search and filter the event data and also allows for independent processing and filtering.

Event
-----

.. |event| replace:: `Event`_

An |event| object is a GeoJSON with the following keys:

.. data:: geometry

    .. |geometry| replace:: :data:`geometry`

    The |geometry| object contains the coordinates for the |event| in the format required by Mapbox. The |geometry| data must be set according to the location information of the |event|. If no location information is provided or can be supplied through the locations API, the event pin cannot be displayed with Mapbox.

    .. code-block:: rest
        :caption: |event| Object Structure:

        geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ ``latitude``, ``longitude`` ]}

    .. attribute:: type

        The *type* of the |geometry| object. Should always be of value ``"Point"`` as |event| locations are treated as a point with a singular ``(latitude, longitude)`` pair.

        .. note:: An |geometry|'s type will always be of value "Point".

    .. attribute:: geometry.coordinates

        The *coordinates* of the |geometry| object. Contains ``latitude`` and ``longitude`` Number values that correspond to the location of the |event|.

        :latitude: a Number value between the range ``(-90, 90)``

        :longitude: a Number value between the range ``(-180, 180)``

.. data:: id

    .. |id| replace:: :data:`id`

    The |id| contains a unique *ID* for the |event| object.

    .. note:: Each |id| is unique. This allows for searching for events by index.

.. data:: properties

    .. |properties| replace:: :data:`properties`

    Contains all the |event| information and will be explored further below.

    .. code-block:: rest
        :caption: |properties| Object Structure:

        properties: { 
          category: "<NONE>", 
          duplicate_occurence: false, 
          is_cancelled: false, 
          name: "Mappening Launch", 
          start_time: "2018-08-21T04:20:00-0700", 
          stats: { attending: #, interested: #, maybe: #, noreply: # }
        }
        
    **Mandatory Event Properties**

        These properties must have a valid value for every event.

        .. attribute:: category

            The *category* of the |event|. All the categories can be seen by dynamically calling ``/categories``. About half of events have a category and the rest have <NONE>. TODO is this mandatory because I see events where it is missing.

        .. attribute:: name

            The String of the |event|'s name. A specific event can be searched by calling ``/name/<event_name>``.

        .. attribute:: stats

            The JSON for events from Facebook with attendance stats with a ~6 hour accuracy. Contains 4 keys: ``attending``, ``noreply``, ``interested``, and ``maybe``, each with an integer value.

        .. attribute:: start_time

            The String start time of the |event| in the format ``Sat, 17 Feb 2018 23:30:00 GMT-0800``.
            
        .. attribute:: is_cancelled

            The Boolean indicating that the |event| is cancelled.
            
        .. attribute:: duplicate_occurrence

            The Boolean indicating this is a single |event| taking place on multiple days i.e a weekly farmers market, not a multiday event like a hackathon.

    **Potential Event Properties**

        If these details/properties aren't present, the JSON keys won't be present.

        .. attribute:: cover_picture

            The String url to the cover picture associated with the |event|.

        .. attribute:: time_updated

            The time the |event| was last updated.

        .. attribute:: description

            The String of the |event|'s description.

        .. attribute:: place

            A JSON with a ``location`` key with a mandatory ``country``, ``city``, ``latitude``, and ``longitude``. Other potential place details such as ``name`` can be seen in the example event below.

        .. attribute:: hoster

            The String of the host name.

        .. attribute:: ticket_uri

            The link to the |event|'s ticketing.

        .. attribute:: end_time

            The String end time of the |event| in the format ``Sat, 17 Feb 2018 23:30:00 GMT-0800``.

        .. attribute:: free_food

            Whether or not the |event| has free food, currently just a strong NO.
