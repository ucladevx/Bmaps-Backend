In 1955, America lost its Rebel. In 2003, Edwin Donovan changed the story. James Dean America is a heartwarming comedy-drama about the the power of stories, the magic of the movies, and the impact of empathy as well as a little tribute to one of UCLA's most famous students, James Dean.  In 2003, a wide-eyed producer's assistant stumbles upon a gem of a script that was to star James Dean before the fatal car crash, so he tracks down the cantankerous screenwriter (now in his 70s) who refuses to sell the script without the blessing of James Dean whom he swears is still alive. Join us for a fun, engaging afternoon to benefit the awesome non-profit Young Storytellers which provides mentorship to students in low-income schools on how to write stories and discover the power of their voice.  A student's short script will be performed before the reading.  All ticket proceeds will go to Young Storytellers. We look forward to seeing you at the movies...we mean the live-read!

If we had to give the screenplay a rating, it would probably be on the cusp of PG-13 for one scene that has brief strong language and some instances of mild language.

Artists, songwriters, producers, engineers – in short – music makers: How does someone - fan or business - search for you online today? Where do they go to find you? How would a brand, a film, a commercial or an app with a budget for a song go about getting in touch with you to use a track you wrote or were involved in? Are you aware that about 1/4 of a $45 billion industry gets paid to the wrong person/organisation or not at all due to missing data? Currently all information pertaining who we are as music makers - our discographies, biographies, press kits, IDs, contacts, representation, etc in short: our data - is currently uploaded and stored all over the place online and not necessarily by us, creating a huge data mess complicating the admin process like getting paid and resulting in missed opportunities, monies and collaborations. So what is the solution? Spearheaded by Imogen Heap working with other music makers and technologists, we have created The Creative Passport – a digital identity container - which would hold all information about you as a music maker. Like an IMdB + Linkedin for music if you like. With all our information in one place, we would gain visibility through search-ability, streamline time-consuming admin and likely aid the process in getting paid quicker and more fairly with new income streams and opportunities arising as well. Why come to this event? For the Creative Passport to be effective however we need music makers around the world to sign up to it, so we are hosting forums where you as music-makers can input into the development of The Creative Passport. We will share our vision of how we hope it will evolve, exchange ideas and have an open dialogue and together, we can work to shape the Creative Passport into what we need it to be. As part of these forums, we will also have the first beta version of the Creative Passport app available to download and test together and share with other music makers. So if you want to be part of the Mycelia family and to be in a position where you transform the industry for good, then sign up and share the invite with your colleagues/collaborators/friends!","https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F59871378%2F240349585838%2F1%2Foriginal.20190406-150817?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C22%2C2488%2C1244&s=b5c1e6f94745d76ab2537bfee2bc5e2d",false

With the decline of princely states’ traditional patronage systems, musicians, among others, began to gravitate to the rapidly growing colonial city of Bombay, in search of new sponsors. This led, in turn, to the formation of a distinctive audience for Hindustani sangeet in the city – one not limited to the princely courts and exclusive homes of the aristocracy. Phir se samm pe aana strives to experience the space for Hindustani classical music in Bombay. The film revisits the sites clustered in and around Girgaon, which was part of the native town of the colonial city and was one of the key neighborhoods where singers, patrons, and the audiences lived. The film seeks to understand the musical legacy of this neighborhood, even as it reimagines the documentary mode. This film ‘listens’ to architectural structures in an attempt to reflect on the deep history of this practice. In narrativising the love of music that took shape in this neighborhood, we also seek to experience ‘film time’ rather than evoke a time past or record the present. The film seeks repetition and cyclical time to imagine a narrative on music. Phir se…is an opportunity to experience an interior, almost intimate practice of the musical form. This film emerged from a collaborative research project of Surabhi Sharma and Dr. Tejaswini Niranjana, aimed at understanding Hindustani classical music as part of the intangible urban history of the metropolis of Bombay/Mumbai.

This talk focuses on the manifestations of musicophilia in Mumbai from the late 19th century to the present. Niranjana proposes that this phenomenon of music-loving, and the concept of a lingua musica, help us grasp the workings of the metropolitan unconscious of a large colonial port-city like Mumbai, throwing new light on issues of the subjective and the social.

Savior Spectatorship and the Production of Iranian Dancers as “Objects of Rescue”Thursday, June 6, 2019 12 p.m. to 1:50 p.m.Kaufman Hall 208 RSVP Requested Because of Iranian state-implemented restrictions on public dance performance, effective since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, diasporic spaces are often constructed as offering Iranian dancers the unconditional freedom to fully realize themselves as artists. In this narrative, Iranian dancers gain agential freedom – a dancer’s subjecthood – only through non-Iranian spaces, whether geographical or familial. In turn, I argue that this account constructs Iranian dancers as what transnational feminist scholar Inderpal Grewal calls “object of rescue.” Building upon transnational feminist analyses on Euro-American (neo)colonial “saving” enterprises, this talk draws critical parallels between the militaristic imperative to “save” Muslim women at the start of the US-led War on Terror and the discursive frameworks that position Iranian dancers as needing to be saved from the Iranian state, their families, or from Islam, which ostensibly forbid them to dance. Drawing on research from my larger book project, the talk focuses specifically on dancer-choreographer Afshin Ghaffarian, who was granted asylum in France in 2009. I analyze the French reception of Ghaffarian's live performances and the American-produced biographical dramatic film, Desert Dancer (2014), which portrays Ghaffarian’s life as an aspiring dancer in Iran and his defection to Paris. I develop a theory of what I call savior spectatorship, a multi-modal kinesthetic looking practice that operates within transmedia environments wherein discourses and images (static and moving) construct Iranian dancers as victims and their Euro-American and diasporic audiences as compassionate saviors. As a pervasive form of twenty-first century cosmopolitan subject formation, I suggest that savior spectatorship is produced and sustained through historical and contemporary sociopolitical power relations and (neo)colonial saving enterprises. My theorizations of savior spectatorship complicate prevalent assumptions that hold active spectatorship and kinesthetic empathy as inherently critical or politically progressive acts of engagement with dance performance. Instead, I interrogate how dance becomes a barometer with which to measure modernity, freedom, and humanity, and how savior spectatorship of Iranian dancers constructs a model of Iranianness that fits all too neatly within Euro-American geopolitical paradigms that position Iran as backward and pre-modern.  Heather Rastovac Akbarzadeh is a UC Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellow in UC Davis’s Department of Asian American Studies under the mentorship of Dr. Sunaina Maira. From 2016 – 2018, Heather was the Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Dance Studies at Stanford University. She earned her Ph.D. in Performance Studies from UC Berkeley with a Designated Emphasis in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. Heather’s research, which extends upon two decades as a dancer-choreographer among Iranian American communities, examines the lives and artistic works of diasporic Iranian dancers and performance artists residing in North America and Western Europe. Heather engages in ethnography, discourse analysis, and performance analysis to investigate the racialized and gendered economies of Iranian performance in transnational art markets and among diasporic audiences. Her current book project investigates how global War on Terror biopolitics construct Iranian dancers as neoliberal subjects of freedom. An examination of choreographic content, media coverage, and audience reception of performances by diasporic Iranians in North America and Europe reveal how colonial histories of Euro-American “saving” practices are animated through discourses surrounding these dancers and their performances.
